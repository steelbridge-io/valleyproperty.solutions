Valley Property Solutions, LLC is a residential redevelopment company based out of Cottonwood, CA. With the belief that remodeled homes are essential to new America, Valley Property Solutions focuses on purchasing distressed/ outdated homes. Once we purchase a property we start renovations. After the renovations are complete we then sell the property to a new homeowner/landlord.

When Christian Magana, owner of Valley Property Solutions graduated from High School he knew that he wanted to get into the game of real estate. After investing thousands into his real estate education and learning the proper tools to run a business, it was time to get started. Valley Property Solutions was established May 24, 2019 with the goal of creating gorgeous homes for new families while also helping the previous owners in any way we can.
