### What Properties Catch Our Attention?
Valley Property Solutions, LLC is a residential redevelopment company. Residential redevelopment is renovating outdated or damaged homes and making them have a more clean, modern feeling to them. We believe that residential redevelopment is essential to the growth of new America and we’re proud to help contribute. If you have a house for sale that’s outdated, or just needs some T.L.C. don’t hesitate to give us a call at <a href="tel:15304462271" title="Telephone Number">(530) 446-2271</a>. A majority of our focus goes to purchasing these type of properties. Since we remodel the house anyway, we love to buy in "as is” condition. Your time is valuable to us so please give us a call so we can give you an all cash offer and close at lightning fast speeds.

#### For Sale By Owner
Houses that are for sale by owner catch our attention because this means a possible wholesale deal.
